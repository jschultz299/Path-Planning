# Path-Planning

Motion Planning for robotics consists of moving a robot from a start state to a goal state while avoiding obstacles as well as obeying constraints such as joint and torque limits.

Path Planning is a subset of the larger field of Motion Planning. Path planning consists of finding the geometric path that connects a start state to a goal state, while avoiding obstacles. In path planning, however, we ignore robot dynamics and additional environmental and motion constraints.

In this repository, we explore two common path planning algorithms:
1. A* search algorithm
2. Rapidly Exploring Random Trees
