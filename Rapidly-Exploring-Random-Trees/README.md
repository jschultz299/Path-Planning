# Rapidly Exploring Random Trees

In the previous project, we explored the A* Graph Search algorithm, where we used the algorithm to search a true representation of an environment to find the optimal path. It's often difficult or impossible to completely represent or model the environment in real applications, however.

For this reason, we need to use sampling path planning methods that allow us to build a representation of the environment as we explore.

One popular sampling path planning method is called a Rapidly Exploring Random Tree.
